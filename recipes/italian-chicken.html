    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here you see the delectable and wonderful work of art that Italian Chicken.</p>
       <p> It is called Italian Chicken because it is marinated in a delicious italian dressing, then baked. <br>
        It's the absolute easiest thing you can imagine preparing, and the payoff is evident with each bite.</p>
    </p>
<p>Here are the ingredients you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
         <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are the steps you will follow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour salad dressing into a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts, seal bag, and shake to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight (the longer you marinate, the more flavor the chicken will absorb).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish; discard remaining marinade.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning chicken occasionally, until cooked through and juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
